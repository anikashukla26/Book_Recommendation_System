📚 Book Recommendation System
This is a content-based Book Recommendation System built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It recommends similar books based on user input using cosine similarity from the scikit-learn library. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard is provided to visualize important insights from the dataset.
